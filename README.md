# OpenAGI
Building an Open Artificial General Intelligence


## Requirements 

1. An agent interacting with the world (modeled as an partially observable (only seen through the eyes of sensors) environment).
2. Solid learning ability (for any kind of function to solve any kind of task). Must be able to leverage all types of ML based on the learning objective (RL, SL, UL).
3. Reasoning (e.g. self-reflection) & Inferencing based on available knowledge for drawing conclusions,
 to subsequently derive actions for maximazing a utility/ goal function. 
4. A way to measure intelligence (comprehensive intelligence test).


## Design 

1. A modular setup for all important areas (emotion, nlp, usw. ).
2. A communication component to transmit information between modules.
3.
